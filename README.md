# PowerBI-MapViewer

The MapViewer Visual from GeoAI brings the power of a highly-configurable map to your Microsoft PowerBI report. This feature-rich Visual lets you show locations in your report on a basemap of your choosing. Web Mapping Service (WMS) layers can be added to enrich your map with extra information. You can create a library of your favourite WMS endpoints and your layer styling and map extent is saved within the Power BI report.
